While we know that digital access is often worse in disadvantaged areas, this project uses recent data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates to measure these patterns more precisely.(2018-2022) We will: Identify areas (census tracts) with low digital access, such as households without internet or computers. Explore how factors like income, education, and housing costs relate to digital access. Build models to predict which communities are most likely to face digital exclusion and which factors matter most. Our goal is to better understand how inequality impacts digital access and provide useful insights for decision-makers working to close the digital gap."
